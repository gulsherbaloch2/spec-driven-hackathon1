# Social Robotics and Communication Interfaces: Creating Natural Human-Robot Communication

Social robotics focuses on developing robots that can interact with humans in natural, intuitive ways. This involves designing robots that can understand human communication, express their own states, and follow social norms. Communication interfaces are the technological solutions that enable effective information exchange between humans and robots. This chapter explores the principles, technologies, and applications of social robotics and communication interfaces.
